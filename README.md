You are assigned two compilers to review, which can be found in `review_assignments.csv`. First, you need to find your own submission ID, by going to your [assignment-3-cobra submission on Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/528266/assignments/2837010/).

After navigating to your submission, you can find your submission ID as part of the URL: `https://www.gradescope.com/courses/528266/assignments/2837010/submissions/**THIS IS YOUR SUBMISSION ID**`

Next, navigate to `review_assignments.csv` and find your submission ID in the first column. The numbers in the second and third column are your assigned compilers. You should be able to find these compilers in the repository above as subdirectories.

Follow the directions in the assignment writeup to read and review the ones you’ve been assigned, and you’ll upload a PDF of your review.
